# Hands-On Concurrency with Rust

This repository contains the source code for 
[Hands-On Concurrency with Rust](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-concurrency-rust). 
Each sub-project is intended to be built with the stable channel of Rust except
where noted in the text of the book. 

## Initialization

Hands-On Concurrency with Rust discusses several community projects. This repository tracks
those crates as submodules. To properly initialize this repository please issue
the following commands:

```
> git submodule init
> git submodule update
```

If you have not yet cloned the repository and have at least git 2.13 you may
issue this command instead:

```
> git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-On-Concurrency-with-Rust.git
```
