# Rust Concurrency

This repository contains the source code for [Rust
Concurrency](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/rust-concurrency). Each
sub-project is intended to be built with the stable channel of Rust.

## Initialization

Rust Concurrency discusses several community projects. This repository tracks
those crates as submodules. To properly initialize this repository please issue
the following commands:

```
> git submodule init
> git submodule update
```

If you have not yet cloned the repository and have at least git 2.13 you may
issue this command instead:

```
> git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Rust-Concurrency.git
```
